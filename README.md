GreedyGoblin is a generic filter, I don't go line by line editing every possible item. I have constructed the script in a very readable manner, if you want to edit it some please feel free and just rename it so it saves. If you don't want a certain item to show, you can delete that block or comment it out, either will work. If you want something else to show, please add it in accordingly to prevent issues. POD scripts read in order of tier, so you need to label Superior items > Non-magic items > Inferior items, from top to bottom.

Here's how it works:

Ethereal items have a purple ETH prior to name

Spears and polearms over 4OS are shown

0/5/6 OS Berserker axe are shown

CTA/Hoto bases are shown.

0/3/5 2H Elite Swords are shown 

0 and 4OS shields show after 60, before 60 2/3 OS show as well. Ethereal paladin shields show after 60.

White rune word bases, Assassin +3 claws, Sorceress +3 staves, and Amazon +3 skill bases are shown.

OOC, any rune Lem+, and high value items have alerts and a sexy female voice

Any crap item that is 1 box wide first gets checked for gold value, if worth enough it will show up as its value

After 60 Scepter bases don't show, I haven't built the filter around those yet. So if you're wanting to make a runeword in a scepter, temporarily disable GreedyGoblin.

•Bows/Xbows received massive filtering changes. Only 0 and 4OS Greatbows show now.

•Skills now compound on each other (Wands/Staves/Claws) ie: White base will show +BS/+CE inline. Modular by design giving a more simple view while on ground.

•Small revisions to some bases that should only show when Ethereal

•General styling changes for high value drops

•Made it easier to be greedy with high value runes/drops (Big box mode for stealing from unworthy players in your maps)
